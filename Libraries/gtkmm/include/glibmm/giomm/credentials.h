/** An object containing credentials.

 *
 * Some operating systems supports looking up the credentials of the remote

 *
 * Some operating systems supports securely sending and receiving credentials
 * over a Unix Domain Socket, see UnixCredentialsMessage,
 * Gio::UnixConnection::send_credentials() and
 * Gio::UnixConnection::receive_credentials() for details.
 *
 * On Linux, the native credential type is a struct ucred - see the unix(7)
 * man page for details. This corresponds to
 * Gio::CREDENTIALS_TYPE_LINUX_UCRED.
 *
 * On FreeBSD, the native credential type is a struct cmsgcred. This
